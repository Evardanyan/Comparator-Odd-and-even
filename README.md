# Comparator-Odd-and-even

Write a method that takes a List of Integer numbers and returns a List containing the same Integer numbers sorted according to the following rules:
In the sorted List, odd numbers should be at the beginning in ascending order and even numbers should be at the end in descending order. You don't need to read or write anything from or to the console, just implement the method.
